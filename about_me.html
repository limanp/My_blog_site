                My name is Pasha. At the moment I want to become a good programmer. 
                I was born and live in the city of Novograd-Volynsky, later I want to move to Zhytomyr.
                My year of birth is 07/14/2002. My hobbies are now in active search, but if you think about it, 
                you can say that this is physical education and reading manga, I want to end the latter. 
                I am currently studying at the Zhytomyr Polytechnic University. Shortly before that, 
                I studied at JKKBP, where a year passed and I left for personal reasons. 
                At the moment I am struggling with my desires and HUGE laziness 
                (it's a little sad that people younger than me are ahead of me in development, 
                despite the fact that I have all the conditions for productive learning).</div>
